# Image Classifier Project

This project is part of the **AI Programming with Python Nanodegree Program**, where you will develop an **image classifier** capable of recognizing different species of flowers. You will build and train a deep learning model and convert it into a command-line application for real-world use.

## Introduction

As AI algorithms are increasingly integrated into everyday applications, this project demonstrates how to develop an image classifier to identify flower species. For instance, this could be used in a smartphone app to identify flowers captured by the camera.

By completing this project, you will:
- Train a deep learning model to classify flower images.
- Build a command-line application that predicts flower species based on user input.
- Learn skills to develop similar models for other datasets and applications.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is from [Oxford's 102 Flower Categories](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html). It contains 102 flower species with labeled images. Below are some example images from the dataset:

## Project Workflow

The project is divided into the following steps:

1. **Loading and Preprocessing Data**  
   Prepare the image dataset by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting images for training.

2. **Model Training**  
   Build and train a deep learning model using a pre-trained network (e.g., VGG16, ResNet).

3. **Prediction and Evaluation**  
   Test the model on unseen images and evaluate its accuracy. Implement a command-line interface for predictions.

4. **Deployment**  
   Export the trained model and use it for real-world applications.

## Installation

To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- torchvision
- jupyter notebook

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/aipnd-project.git
cd aipnd-project
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

### Train the Model
Run the training script:
```bash
python train.py --data_dir path_to_dataset --save_dir path_to_save_model --epochs 10
```

### Make Predictions
Use the prediction script:
```bash
python predict.py --image_path path_to_image --checkpoint path_to_model
```

### Options
- `--top_k`: Number of top predictions to display.
- `--category_names`: Path to JSON file mapping categories to names.

Example:
```bash
python predict.py --image_path flower.jpg --checkpoint checkpoint.pth --top_k 5 --category_names cat_to_name.json
```
